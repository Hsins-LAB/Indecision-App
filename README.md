# Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and run this project on your local machine.

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
# Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Hsins/udemy_Indecision-App.git
```

2. Install dependencies via NPM or Yarn

Since that [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages) can only publish site's source files from `master`, `gh-pages` branch, or a `/docs` folder on master branch. I use `git subtree push` command to push the file in `public` file to `gh-pages`:

```bash
$ git subtree push --prefix public origin gh-pages
```
